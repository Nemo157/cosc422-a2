Building and Running
====================

Building should be as simple as just running `make` in the main folder.  This
will create the program `basic` which should be called

    ./basic [flags] [path to OFF file]

e.g. `./basic models/horse.off` to use the model that the report was based off.
By default the horse model will be used.

Controls
========

All keys listed below must be lowercase when pushed.

Looking
-------

Hold down the left mouse button and use the mouse to look around.

Navigation
----------

Use 'A', 'W', 'S', 'D', 'Z' and the spacebar to move the viewpoint left,
forwards, back, right, up and down respectively.

Other
-----

'Q':
  Toggle rotation of the model.
'E':
  Toggle showing the FPS in the console.
'R':
  Switch to the next shader model.

Dvorak Users
============

     Note: this is designed for programmer's Dvorak, normal dvorak users will
     notice the 'Z' and 'Q' remappings are backwards.

If you use Dvorak you can pass the `--dvorak` flag to change the controls as
follows:

    'W' -> ','
    'S' -> 'O'
    'D' -> 'E'
    'Z' -> '''
    'Q' -> ';'
    'E' -> '.'
    'R' -> 'P'
